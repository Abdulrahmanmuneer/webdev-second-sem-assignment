<h1 > Intro to our Turtle Population</h1> <!--first header-->
 <img src="slturtles.jpeg" alt="turtleinfo" class="img0">
 <p > The Sri Lankan turtle population is an intriguing and important part of the country's diverse biodiversity.
  Sri Lanka is well-known for being an important nesting place for several endangered turtle species, making it a notable
   global conservation hotspot. These amazing creatures use the island's pristine beaches as essential nesting grounds.</p>
<br>
  <p>
    Sea turtles such as the Green Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Olive Ridley Turtle, and Leatherback Turtle can be found in 
    Sri Lankan waters. These turtles travel amazing distances across wide oceans to breed in their birthplace, a phenomenon
     known as natal homing.

    The conservation of the Sri Lankan turtle population is critical not only for the survival of these amazing creatures,
     but also for the ecological balance of marine ecosystems. Efforts to conserve them will help to ensure the long-term 
     sustainability and preservation of Sri Lanka's natural heritage.</p>

       <p >Turtles have been around for over 200 million years. They are known for their bony shells and slow movement.
         They come in various sizes, from small species like the Bog turtle to large ones like the Leatherback turtle. Turtles can 
         live in diverse habitats, including oceans, rivers, and forests.</p>

        <h1>Role of Sea Turtles in Ecosystems</h1> <!--third header-->

        <img src="green3.jpeg" alt="greenturtle" class="img2">

        <p >Sea turtles are critical to the health of marine ecosystems. They help control seagrass beds as herbivores by grazing
           on the flora, reducing overgrowth and preserving biodiversity.
          Their feeding habits also help to enhance nutrient cycling and the health of seagrass environments. 
          Furthermore, sea turtles operate as predators, preying on jellyfish and other invertebrates, so regulating their
           populations.</p>
           <br>
           <br>
           
           <p>By controlling jellyfish abundance, they indirectly protect fish populations
            and maintain the balance of the food chain. Furthermore, their nesting activities contribute to the nutrient 
            enrichment of beaches, supporting the growth of vegetation and providing habitat for other species. 
            Sea turtles are integral components of marine ecosystems, and their conservation is essential for preserving 
            the overall health and biodiversity of our oceans.</p>
            <p>In conclucsion:</p>
            <ol> <!-- oordered list-->
              <li>Sea turtles help maintain healthy marine ecosystems by feeding on seagrass, which prevents overgrowth and
                 provides habitat for other marine organisms. </li>
              <li>Their eggs and hatchlings provide crucial nutrients to dune vegetation, supporting coastal stability and 
                  protecting against erosion.</li>
              <li>Sea turtles contribute to nutrient cycling by consuming jellyfish, controlling their population
                     and preventing ecosystem imbalances.</li>
               <li>Sea turtles contribute to nutrient cycling by consuming jellyfish, controlling their population and preventing ecosystem 
                imbalances.</li>
               <li>Sea turtle nests provide opportunities for scavengers and organisms in the beach ecosystem, 
                enhancing overall ecological resilience.</li>

    <h1 >Life Cycle and Behaviors of turtles</h1>  <!--fourth header-->

  <img src="lifecycle.jpeg" class="img4">  

    <p>Sea turtles have a fascinating and distinctive life cycle. During the nesting season, adult females come ashore to 
      lay their eggs on sandy beaches. They dig carefully and place their eggs before covering them with sand.
      After an incubation period, the hatchlings emerge and make their way instinctively to the ocean, encountering several 
      barriers and predators along the way.
     <br>
     <br>
      Once in the water, sea turtles go through a period known as the "lost years." During this time, they disperse across 
      the ocean, undergoing growth and development as they feed on a variety of marine organisms. As they mature, sea turtles 
      return to coastal areas, often to the same beach where they were born, to mate and nest.
      <br>
      <br>
      Throughout their lives, sea turtles exhibit a variety of behaviors. They eat seagrass, algae, jellyfish, and other
       marine invertebrates and are primarily herbivorous or omnivorous. Some animals migrate across large distances
        between feeding and breeding grounds. Mating rituals include wooing displays and competition among males for 
        female attention. </p>
